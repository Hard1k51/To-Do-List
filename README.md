To-Do List Project
Overview
Welcome to the To-Do List Project! This simple console-based application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing features to add tasks, delete tasks, list all tasks, and quit the application.

Features
1. Add Tasks
Users can add tasks to their to-do list by entering task names, separated by commas. The input is processed, and the tasks are added to the list.

2. Delete Task
Users can delete a specific task from the to-do list by selecting the task's index. The current tasks are displayed, and users input the index of the task they want to delete.

3. List Tasks
Users can view a list of all current tasks in their to-do list. This feature helps users keep track of their tasks and priorities.

4. Quit
Users can exit the application at any time by selecting the "Quit" option. The application expresses gratitude for using the To-Do List before terminating.

Usage
Run the program, and a menu with options (1-4) will be displayed.
Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action:
1: Add Tasks
2: Delete Task
3: List Tasks
4: Quit
